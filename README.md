ladder
======

An elm single page application for a singles pool league where players schedule their own matches and are rated by the Elo algorithm.

## Developing

You'll need

- an API key for a running instance of the [backend](https://github.com/jisantuc/ladder-backend)
- [elm](https://elm-lang.org/)

## Why elm

I'm optimistic that if I'm successful in making this other people will be able to click "deploy to Heroku" for
the backend and something analogous with Netlify or something for the frontend. For that to work without an
exploding maintenance burden, I need the no runtime exceptions promise that elm makes.
